What is AWS elastic beanstalk?
It gives easy and quick deployment of applications in AWS Cloud.

How it Works?
•	Platform already built you only need to upload your code
•	EBS automatically handles the deployment including load-balancer, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring.

Points on EBS?
•	Focus on writing code instead of managing, configuring, database, load-balancer, firewall and network
•	EBS uses core AWS services like EC2, ECS, Auto-scaling, and ELB to easily support application that need to scale to serve millions of users.
•	EBS has access to the server 
•	EBS has full control on EC2 instances which are launched by EBS
•	EBS will handle EC2 on our behalf i.e. (OS, network, storage) 
•	It is a regional  service
•	We need to provide configuration to EBS like VPC, AMI, Auto-scaling, ELB, Security Group, Platform etc.
•	Provide pre-configured platforms like Python, Java, Ruby, Go, PHP, etc. we can deploy code to this platform.
(Deployment means putting your code into the server)
•	In EBS AWS will take care of the infrastructure (ELB, ASG etc.)
•	In EBS one code for one application.

Pricing in EBS?
•	EBS is free of cost just need to pay for the underlying services that we use.
•	Pay only for what you use
•	No minimum fees or  no  upfront commitment.

Different Deployment Types in EBS?
1. Single Instance Deployment
2. High Availability Deployment

.In EBS we can swap the URL's of different environments (e.g. Blue-Green Environment).
