IAM
IAM is used for managing users,groups,access policies and roles.

HOW IT WORKS?

IAM can configure authorization what resources user can access and what they can do with those resources.

Important note:

1)Groups in aws iam can contain only user.

2)User in aws iam can belong to multiple groups.

3)Instead of using the root account we can create users and use them for security purpose.
